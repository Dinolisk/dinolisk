                    <p> JavaScript was born on the Internet, and came out with the advent of browsers. </p>
                    <p> Looking back at its history, we must start with the history of the browser.
                        At the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at the European Organization for Nuclear Energy
                        Research
                        (CERN), invented the World Wide Web based on the Internet, the world's largest computer network,
                        and was
                        able to
                        browse web pages online. The earliest web pages can only be viewed in the terminal of the
                        operating
                        system, that
                        is to say, only the command line operation can be used, and the web pages are displayed in the
                        character
                        window,
                        which is of course very inconvenient. </p>
                    <p> At the end of 1992, the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) began developing a
                        standalone
                        browser called Mosaic. This is the first browser in human history, from which the web page can
                        be viewed
                        in a
                        graphical interface window.</p>
                    <p> In October 1994, a major NCSA programmer, Marc Andreessen, joined venture capitalist Jim Clark
                        to form
                        Mosaic
                        Communications, which was later renamed Netscape. The direction of this company is to develop a
                        new
                        generation
                        of browsers for ordinary users based on Mosaic. Netscape Navigator</p>
                    <p>In December 1994, Navigator released version 1.0 with a market share of more than 90%.</p>
                    <p>etscape quickly discovered that the Navigator browser needed a scripting language that could be
                        embedded
                        in web
                        pages to control browser behavior. At that time, the network speed was very slow and the
                        Internet access
                        fee was
                        very expensive, and some operations should not be completed on the server side. For example, if
                        the user
                        forgets
                        to fill in the "username", he clicks the "send" button. It is a bit too late to find this on the
                        server.
                        It is
                        best to tell the user "please fill in the username" before the user sends the data. This
                        requires
                        embedding a
                        small program in the web page and letting the browser check if each column is filled.</p>
                    <p>The management's vision for this browser scripting language is that the functionality does not
                        need to be
                        too
                        strong, the syntax is simple, and it is easy to learn and deploy. That year, just after Sun's
                        Java
                        language came
                        out, the marketing campaign was very successful. Netscape decided to work with Sun to support
                        embedded
                        Java
                        applets (later called Java applets). However, whether the browser scripting language chooses
                        Java is
                        controversial. Later, I decided not to use Java because the web applet didn't need the "heavy"
                        syntax of
                        Java.
                        However, it also determines that the syntax of the scripting language is close to Java and can
                        support
                        Java
                        programs. These assumptions directly rule out the use of existing languages such as Perl,
                        Python, and
                        TCL.</p>
                    <p> In 1995, Netscape hired programmer Brendan Eich to develop this web scripting language. Brendan
                        Eich has
                        a
                        strong background in functional programming and hopes to implement this new language based on
                        the Scheme
                        language (a dialect of the LISP language of the functional language).</p>
                    <P> In May 1995, Brendan Eich designed the first version of the language in just 10 days. It is a
                        hodgepodge
                        with
                        multiple sources of grammar.</P>
                    <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
                    <p> Netscape's browser scripting language, originally called Mocha, changed to LiveScript in
                        September 1995.
                        In
                        December, Netscape and Sun (the inventor and owner of the Java language) reached an agreement
                        that
                        allowed the
                        language to be called JavaScript. In this way, Netscape can leverage the power of the Java
                        language, and
                        Sun has
                        extended its reach to the browser.</p>
                    <p>On December 4, 1995, Netscape and Sun jointly released the JavaScript language, which promoted
                        JavaScript
                        as a
                        supplement to Java. It is a lightweight Java that is designed to operate web pages.</p>
                    <p>In March 1996, the Navigator 2.0 browser officially built the JavaScript scripting language.</p>
